# Become a Sofware Developer - Radium Rocket

## Week 04

In the week 04, based on the Los Angeles Times website, I rewrited the project of week 03 about "responsive web desing" because I have to correct some mistakes. The focus of this week was:

    - Desinging a website for Mobile-first and adding MediaQueries to create breakpoints for Laptop and Desktop visualization.

    - Using Flexbox to organize the content of the website.

## Week 05

In the week 05, following the work I created in the website of the week 04, I had to create a subscription form and make the correspondings "client-side validation". The focus of this week was:

    - DOM manipulation to access specific elements of the document.

    - Utilizing Javascript Events to make the corresponding validations of each fields.

## Week 06

In the week 06, following the work I created in the website of the week 05, I worked on the sending of the data to a web server provided by the instructors of the course and create a "server-side validation of the subscription form" utilizing a modal to communicate the validation. Also, I worked to use the data of the form to save it in the localStorage of the browser so the user doesn't have to subscribe again every time he enters the website. The focus of this week was:

    - HTTP and HTTPS requests and responses for sending the data.

    - Creating a modal that shows the validation of the data sent to the web server.

    - localStorage to save the input data in the browser.
